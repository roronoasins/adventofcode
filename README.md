# Advent of Code

I will upload my aoc python3 solutions here.

Inside a specific year folder, a `test/` folder is placed, where you can find tests that check if the current days
solutions placed in `year/src/` retrieves the expected output. This allows anyone to modify the solution for any day
and then run the test with pytest to check if it is correct(You have to read the documentation of the tests to avoid
formatting problems).
